# AI-Powered-Code-Compliance-Tool
Create an AI-driven solution that allows users to upload an address and specify the type of project, subsequently generating code compliance for that address and type of project.. The ideal candidate should have experience in AI development, web integration, and a solid understanding of coding regulations. Your expertise will be crucial in building a user-friendly platform that streamlines the compliance process that i can integrate onto my go high level website. If you have a passion for innovative technology and a background in code compliance, we would love to hear from you!
================
To create an AI-driven solution that allows users to upload an address and specify a project type to generate code compliance information, the following Python-based architecture can be implemented. This includes AI integration, web development, and code compliance rules retrieval, all of which can be embedded into a platform like Go High Level.
Features:

    Address Input and Validation:
        Users can input or upload an address.
        Address verification via APIs like Google Maps or OpenCage Geocoder.
    Project Type Specification:
        Dropdown or text input for specifying the type of project (e.g., residential, commercial).
    Code Compliance Retrieval:
        Use AI to query building code databases or interpret local regulations based on the address and project type.
    Output Customization:
        Generate a PDF or web-based compliance report.

Python Code Example:

import os
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, render_template
from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename
import openai
import requests
import pdfkit  # For generating PDFs from HTML

# Flask App Initialization
app = Flask(__name__)

# Configuration
app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = './uploads'
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'txt', 'pdf', 'docx'}
openai.api_key = 'your_openai_api_key'

# Helper Functions
def allowed_file(filename):
    return '.' in filename and filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1].lower() in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS

def get_address_details(address):
    """Fetch details of the address using a geocoding API."""
    api_url = f"https://api.opencagedata.com/geocode/v1/json?q={address}&key=your_opencage_api_key"
    response = requests.get(api_url)
    return response.json()

def get_code_compliance(address_details, project_type):
    """Generate code compliance based on address and project type using AI."""
    prompt = f"""
    Given the location details: {address_details} and the project type: {project_type},
    provide a detailed explanation of code compliance, referencing relevant local regulations.
    """
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=1500
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Routes
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
    if 'file' not in request.files:
        return jsonify({'error': 'No file uploaded.'}), 400
    file = request.files['file']
    if file and allowed_file(file.filename):
        filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
        filepath = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename)
        file.save(filepath)
        return jsonify({'message': f'File {filename} uploaded successfully.'})
    return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid file type.'}), 400

@app.route('/generate_compliance', methods=['POST'])
def generate_compliance():
    data = request.json
    address = data.get('address')
    project_type = data.get('project_type')

    if not address or not project_type:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Address and project type are required.'}), 400

    address_details = get_address_details(address)
    compliance_report = get_code_compliance(address_details, project_type)

    # Save report as PDF
    pdf_filename = f"compliance_report_{address.replace(' ', '_')}.pdf"
    pdf_path = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], pdf_filename)
    pdfkit.from_string(compliance_report, pdf_path)

    return jsonify({'message': 'Compliance report generated.', 'report': pdf_filename})

# Main
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Integration with Go High Level

    Host the Flask App:
        Use cloud hosting services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud to host the Python Flask app.
        Deploy the app and obtain its API endpoints.
    Embed as Widget or API:
        Use Go High Levelâ€™s custom HTML/CSS widget feature to embed this tool.
        Use API integration features in Go High Level to allow communication between the platform and the backend app.
    Connect Frontend UI:
        Provide a user-friendly interface for inputting addresses and project details.

Features for Future Expansion:

    Add automated updates for local building codes using external APIs or government datasets.
    Enable ML models to enhance understanding and extraction of regulations.
    Integrate OCR tools for processing PDF-based code documents.

This architecture creates a robust, scalable, and user-friendly solution tailored to the needs of real estate professionals and can easily integrate with platforms like Go High Level
